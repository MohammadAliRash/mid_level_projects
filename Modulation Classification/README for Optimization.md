This project focuses on optimizing deep learning models for radio signal modulation classification using the RML2016.10a dataset, with a strong emphasis on hyperparameter optimization via Optuna. The dataset, containing signals with varying SNRs and modulation types, is preprocessed to extract raw features and split into 70-30 train-test sets. Labels are binarized for multi-class classification. Two models, an ANN with fully connected layers and a CNN with convolutional layers and dropout, are trained on a GPU using Adam optimizer and CrossEntropyLoss. Optuna, an open-source hyperparameter optimization framework, is employed to enhance model performance by systematically searching for optimal hyperparameters. For the ANN, Optuna tunes learning rate (1e-5 to 1e-2), batch size (512, 1024, 2048), and hidden layer sizes (64-256 and 128-512). For the CNN, it optimizes learning rate, batch size, and convolutional filter sizes (64-256 and 32-128). Over 20 trials, Optuna minimizes validation loss, using early stopping and trial pruning to efficiently explore the search space. The optimized CNN outperforms the ANN, especially at low SNRs, as shown by accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices, demonstrating Optunaâ€™s effectiveness in enhancing model performance for spectrum sensing applications.
